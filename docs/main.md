### Arithemetic Documentation ([arithemtic.md](arithemetic.md))

This documentation file has all the specifics of the arithemetic methods in the Extended Math Library. 

All methods takes in two floats/integers as a tuple. The code verifies whether the numbers are in fact floats/integers. If the inputs given when calling the method are not floats/integers, the method will raise a ValueError. The verified values are placed into a built-in arithemetics formulae and returns the result.

These methods are not dependent on any libraries.

For more information, refer to the [specific arithemetic documentation](arithemetic.md).

### Constants Documentation ([constants.md](constants.md))

This documentation file has all the specifics of the constants methods in the Extended Math Library.

All methods do not take in any inputs. The Pi Method uses formulaes and theroies to calculate the value of Pi. The E Math does not use any formulaes and just returns a preset value of e.

These methods are not dependent on any libraries.

For more information, refer to the [specific constant documentation](constants.md).

## Quadratic Documentation ([quadratic.md](quadratic.md))

This documentation file has all the specifics of the quadratic methods in the Extended Math Library.

All methods take in three floats/integers as a tuple. The code verifies whether the numbers are in fact floats/integers. If the inputs given when calling the method are not floats/integers, the method will raise a ValueError. The verified values are placed into the discrimnant formulae and returns the result.

These methods are not dependent on any libraries.

For more information, refer to the [specific quadratic documentation](quadratic.md).

## Logarithm Documentation ([log.md](log.md))

This documentation file has all the specifics of the logarithm methods in the Extended Math Library.

All methods take in floats/integers. The code verifies whether the number(s) are in fact floats/integers. If the inputs given when calling the method are not floats/integers, the method will raise a ValueError. The verified values are placed into a built-in arithemtic formulae and returns the reuslt.

These methods are not dependent on any libraries.

For more information, refer to the [specific logarithm documentation](log.md).
